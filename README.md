This is a **Tag game** where there are two players - Red and Blue.
The players move with **WASD** and **Arrow Keys** (explained in the game's controls screen)
The player with the red arrow is **IT** and has to touch the other player to get rid of the arrow.
The person with the IT Arrow at the end of the timer loses.

  3. Portals appear every 30 seconds teleportig the players.
  4. Hidden platform in both the maps.
